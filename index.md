Videos
======

Here is the first video. It has steepest descent with and without linesearch,
and the Barzilai-Borwein method. They are synced up so they are running at the
same speed (compared by their step length), so it is a fair comparison.

![100 points, repulsion coeff: 1e-4](./pres_short.mp4)

This is the video with more sites. 

![1000 points, repulsion coeff: 6e-6](./pres_long.mp4)

Other stuff
===========

Here are some other interesting movies that show other behavior. 

Here is a movie without the repulsion term, and you can see the points run into
each other and then jump out when the gradient gets singular.
